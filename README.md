# ReslotterGUI

A GUI tool for reslotting mods. Requires python 3.9+. Run `reslotterGUI.py`, not `reslotter.py`.

You'll need to download a "Hashes_all.txt" file from https://github.com/ultimate-research/archive-hashes/blob/master/Hashes_all, and place it here.

If you are using additional slots, you'll want to forego the config.json generated here, and use CSK's site (https://coolsonickirby.com/arc/dir-info-with-files.html)
