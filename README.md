# ReslotterGUI

![r](https://imgur.com/haexBFf.png)

A GUI tool for reslotting mods. Requires python 3.9+.

You'll need to download a "Hashes_all.txt" file from https://github.com/ultimate-research/archive-hashes/blob/master/Hashes_all, and place it here.

If you are using additional slots, you'll want to forego the config.json generated here, and use CSK's site (https://coolsonickirby.com/arc/dir-info-with-files.html)

## Usage

You may run this program's .py file if you have python installed. Otherwise, I've provided a .exe version. The .py version will always be the most up-to-date version.

### .py: 
Download via the green code button located on the repository (https://github.com/CSharpM7/reslotter) Run `reslotterGUI.py`, not `reslotter.py.
### .exe:
Go to the releases tab and download the exe. Place that exe in it's own folder. Then download the required `Hashes_all.txt` file
